# [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) Hook Order

A repository to demostrate mocha hook order.

## Getting Started

* Run `npm i`
* Run `npm test`

Then check the output from the test files to see when hooks execute. Modify test files as you feel fit to get a better idea of how mocha works. If you're feeling lazy you can check the output, in the [output](output.txt) file.

__Note__: All tests in this example are synchronous so they automatically are handled by mocha to ensure order. If you have asynchronous code make sure you handle it [properly](https://mochajs.org/#asynchronous-code).
